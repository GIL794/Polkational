The project focuses on building an informational, content-driven dashboard environment around Polkadot.
The goal is educational and exploratory — helping developers or learners understand blockchain data, network structure, and ecosystem tools through a simple web interface.

This is intentionally a lightweight project suitable for small grant funding (~under £5k).

Core Objectives
1. Informational Platform

Provide curated blockchain information such as:

Network basics and ecosystem overview

Developer onboarding resources

Educational content about Polkadot architecture

Links to official tools, documentation, and SDKs

👉 Focus is clarity and accessibility, not complex infrastructure.

2. Dashboard Component (Allowed)

A lightweight dashboard to visualize live blockchain data:

Possible features:

Latest block height and chain info

Validator overview (basic list or stats)

Network status indicators

Simple activity feed (blocks/events)

👉 This helps users understand how blockchain data flows.

3. Content-Driven Approach

Strong emphasis on:

Documentation-style explanations

Tutorials or guides

Developer onboarding content

Educational UI components

👉 This aligns well with smaller ecosystem grants.

4. Deployment Demonstration

Include a basic deployment example:

Options:

Simple cloud hosting demo

Static frontend deployment guide

Example environment configuration

Documentation on how to replicate deployment

👉 Shows real usability without heavy infrastructure costs.

Suggested Tech Stack (Simple)

Frontend:

React + TypeScript

polkadot-js API

Basic CSS/card layout UI

Optional minimal backend (only if needed):

Node.js for caching or API proxy

Otherwise frontend-only is acceptable.

Expected Deliverables

Informational web dashboard

Educational documentation

Example blockchain data visualizations
